/**
 * B. QAQ
 * time limit per test: 1 second
 * memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
 * 
 * "QAQ" is a word to denote an expression of crying. Imagine "Q" as eyes with tears and "A" as a mouth.
 * 
 * Now Diamond has given Bort a string consisting of only uppercase English letters of length n. 
 * There is a great number of "QAQ" in the string (Diamond is so cute!).
 * 
 * Bort wants to know how many subsequences "QAQ" are in the string Diamond has given. 
 * Note that the letters "QAQ" don't have to be consecutive, but the order of letters should be exact.
 * 
 * Input
 * The only line contains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). It's guaranteed that the string only contains uppercase English letters.
 * 
 * Output
 * Print a single integer — the number of subsequences "QAQ" in the string.
